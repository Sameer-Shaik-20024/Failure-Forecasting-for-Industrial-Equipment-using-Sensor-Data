# Smart Engine Health Monitoring: Machine Learning Framework for Turbofan RUL Prediction
**Machine Learning Framework for Aircraft Turbofan Engine RUL Prediction**

This research project developed a robust machine learning framework to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft turbofan engines, enabling proactive maintenance strategies and reducing operational risks in aviation.

## Objective
To create a comprehensive predictive maintenance solution that:
- **Predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan engines with high accuracy
- **Evaluates multiple machine learning models** including regression and classification techniques
- **Analyzes critical sensor data** to identify key degradation indicators
- **Enables proactive maintenance scheduling** to minimize unplanned failures

## Dataset
**NASA C-MAPSS Dataset** (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation)
- **Source**: NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence
- **Size**: Multivariate time-series data from 100 engines across their complete lifecycles
- **Features**: 21 sensor measurements + 3 operational settings per engine
- **Structure**: Training data includes full lifecycle to failure; test data ends before failure for RUL prediction
- **Challenges**: Imbalanced dataset with high dimensionality requiring extensive feature engineering

## Methodology

### Machine Learning Models Evaluated:
**Regression Models** (for RUL prediction):
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest Regression
- XGBoost Regression

**Classification Models** (for engine health categorization):
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Na√Øve Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier

### Feature Engineering:
- **Correlation analysis** to identify key predictive features
- **Rolling mean features** (10-cycle windows) to capture temporal degradation patterns
- **Feature selection** removing constant/irrelevant sensors
- **MinMax scaling** for sensor data normalization
- **RUL clipping** at 195 cycles to reduce outliers and improve accuracy

### Risk Categorization:
- **Risk Zone** (RUL ‚â§ 68): Immediate attention required
- **Moderate Risk Zone** (69 ‚â§ RUL ‚â§ 137): Maintenance scheduling advised  
- **No Risk Zone** (RUL > 137): Normal operations
